# Alarm Clock  
An Open-Source, easy to build alarm clock.

## Description
I made this wecker, because I am affraid to oversleep and to be late because of that.  
I use my smartphone for this purpose, but it happens sometimes, that it does not work properly.  
Fortunatelly, there was always something that woke me up in time. Mostly family members.  
Due to my advanced age, it will be time to live my own life and I will not be able to rely on these people anymore.  
To make sure, that I can be in time I wanted to buy a new alarm clock to have beside my smartphone.  
I wanted one which is reliable, not depending on wall power and I can set, manage multiple alarms easily.  
I searced through some sites, but I could not find any, which I liked.  
So I designed my own.  
I wanted to mimik the clock of a general smartphone and set alarms easily through a touchscreen.  
Because I use an ESP32 I also hope to be able to display some notifications through bluetooth and use other features of it in the future.   

## Hardware
### PCB
It is a nearly one sided PCB.   
Unfortunatelly I had to make some GND-connections to the second site to make the design some sort of clean.  
  
Special thanks to [dereisl](https://github.com/dereisl) for the perfect [documentation](https://github.com/dereisl/esp32-radio).  

### Case
It is an easy to print case.  
Probaly will make a new, improved version in the future.
